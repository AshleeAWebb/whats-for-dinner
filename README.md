# What's for Dinner? 

### Abstract:
>This application stores meal options and produces a random selection of either side, entree, or dessert, solving the problem of what's for dinner. The application randomly selects pre-generated and user-input meals and generates the response on the adjacent screen. All user-provided meals are stored in a specific array so that it to can be generated later. 

### Installation Instructions:
> The steps a person would take to clone down and run the app would be as follows:
> 1. Fork the GitHub repository file
> 2. Using the git clone command on their terminal, they could initiate a copy of the required files.
> 3. Once they have cloned the application, they would be able to cd into the directory, and using the open index.HTML string of text it would open the application in their own web browsers so they could enjoy the functionality of the application.

### Learning Goals:
> The learning goal was to experience building an application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This application allowed for the individual challenge of problem-solving and testing the knowledge gained over the last few weeks. It displayed how the different files interact with one another to create a functioning and aesthetically pleasing application. 

### Wins + Challenges:
>Wins for this project understanding how the different files are connected and work together, creating code for the add recipe function without having to google anything, and productively struggling through the radio buttons! The biggest challenge I faced was originally trying to do a for loop to run through the different meal arrays but I could not get it to function. After several attempts to correct but, I was able to step away and think of a workaround that allowed the code to function another challenge was a simple overlook of forgetting to add the hidden feature to the CSS which I did reach out to the cohort for help on.
